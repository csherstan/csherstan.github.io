I’m a research scientist working in the field of Reinforcement Learning. That means I make AI agents that learn to solve tasks from interactions with their world. For example, I was part of a team that (trained an AI agent to outrace the top human racers in the racing game Gran Turismo)[https://ai.sony/blog/blog-016/]. Our agent learned to race by playing against other AI agents, receiving rewards or penalties, and adjusting its behavior to get a higher score.

I’ve been involved in reinforcement learning since 2013 when I started my MSc at the University of Alberta under the supervision of Richard Sutton and Patrick Pilarski. I received the Vanier Scholarship which enabled me to do a PhD under the supervision of Patrick Pilarski. My graduate research was on learning predictive representations of an agent’s interactions with its world using a particular approach from reinforcement learning known as general value functions. During my PhD I had internships with 3 different companies doing RL related work: Cogitai (now part of Sony AI), Borealis AI, and Huawei. I’ve been working as a research scientist at Sony AI since 2020. In that time I’ve managed to get both a Nature paper and a NeurIPS paper published! In 2022 I moved to Tokyo, Japan to work on applying RL to robot control.

In addition to my recent career as an AI researcher I worked for a bit less than a decade in software development with various roles including development, architect, project management, and business development.
