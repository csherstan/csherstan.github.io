<p>Well, back in the spring I received the good news that I had been selected as a <a href="http://www.vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Vanier</a> scholar. As a result, I am able to do a PhD :)</p><p>I successfully defended my MSc thesis in August, and have now started my PhD. Not sure what it will be on yet&hellip; I’d like to make some progress towards uploading my brain to a computer. Maybe I’ll see if I can figure that out :)</p><p>In reality I’ll probably keep focusing on using reinforcement learning for controlling robots. At the moment I’m mostly interested in:</p><ul><li>automatically building knowledge of the world through interaction<br/></li><li>attention mechanisms<br/></li><li>confidence measures<br/></li></ul>
