<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09001">Accelerating Learning in Constructive Predictive Frameworks with the
  Successor Representation</a><br/><p>Iâ€™ve got a new paper with Marlos C. Machado and Patrick M. Pilarski on using the successor representation to speed up learning of incrementally added general value functions.</p>
