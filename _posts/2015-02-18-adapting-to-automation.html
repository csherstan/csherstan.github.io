<p>I am presently working on an MSc in artificial intelligence at the University of Alberta and thinking a lot about automation these days. I&rsquo;m writing this article in response to the large number of articles about the coming AI dangers that I&rsquo;ve been seeing lately. Many have talked about the danger of automated killing machines, but the more <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-to-keep-a-piece-of-the-pie-after-the-robots-take-our-jobs">realistic ones</a>, in my opinion, have been talking about the danger to the workforce.</p><p>There are many applications of automation that do not replace humans in any way, simply because humans could never do those jobs in the first place. For example, the group I work with (<a href="http://blinclab.ca/">The Blinc Lab</a>) is looking at assisting amputees by improving the control of prosthetic arms through the use of AI. Additionally, the study of AI allows us to learn about ourselves and how our minds work.</p><p>However, if we&rsquo;re to be truly honest, the end goal of AI is replicate/replace human thought and ability. Once this is accomplished we have to ask what the value of a flesh and blood human really is?</p><p>There are several ways that we can interpret that question, but I just want to focus on the economic one. Financially, the one who really benefits from automation - in factories, in driving, in financial trading, etc. - is the boss, not those who are replaced. In our society we need money to live and we typically receive money in exchange for some value that we provide. So what happens when what we can provide as human beings is no longer of value?</p><p>A common argument you&rsquo;ll hear is that employers and governments need to invest in retraining their employees. This is beneficial to some degree, but a good chunk of the population is not going to be helped by this. Frankly, many are just too old to retrain. Plus, it&rsquo;s a short term solution. Is our whole population going to become scientists, painters, musicians, and Zumba instructors? Probably not realistic.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to offer two thoughts on how we might address this (without killing off all AI researchers - Yes, I&rsquo;m looking at you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_%282014_film%29">Transcendence</a>).</p><p>1. Robots were supposed to make our lives better. Robots were supposed to give us more time for leisure. A common theme in many science fiction movies and books (Star Trek, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">Culture Series</a>), in which automation has lived up to its promise, is the end of money and the end of the concept of exchanging work for goods. In the case of the Culture, work is performed for various reasons, but the getting of goods is not one of them (I admit they have no scarcity though).Â </p><p>So, and I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m saying this, but maybe we need to start seriously thinking about how to move past money and the exchange of work for goods.</p><p>The most likely alternative is that more and more of the wealth is controlled by fewer people&hellip; wait, aren&rsquo;t we seeing that shift already?</p><p>2. We ourselves must adapt, both physically and mentally. And I don&rsquo;t mean that it in some sort of pep-talk way. I mean literally; we could change our bodies and our minds. Our technology is moving faster than our own evolution. Instead of creating some <i>thing</i> to replace us, let&rsquo;s create better versions of us. I don&rsquo;t want to create a super intellect, I want to become one.</p><p>I realize that second point is probably not too palatable for most, so how about I&rsquo;ll make you a deal - I&rsquo;ll work on that one, you work out the first.</p>
