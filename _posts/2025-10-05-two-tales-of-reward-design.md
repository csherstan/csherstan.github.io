At the end of August, 2025, I gave a talk at the University of Alberta.
The talk was titled ["Two Tales of Reward Design"](https://youtu.be/PrsKX5ZWt_4).

I talked about two different projects that I've worked on at Sony AI.
1. [GT Sophy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04357-7)
A reinforcement learning agent that plays Gran Turismo at a superhuman level.

2. [Value Function Decomposition for Iterative Design of Reinforcement Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13901)
By decomposing the value function into components, we can gain insight into the agent's learning behavior and use this to improve agent design.

A guiding theme to the talk is the importance of reward design in reinforcement learning, something that has largely
been ignored in the community.
