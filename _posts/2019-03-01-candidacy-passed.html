<p>This is a bit old, but I successfully passed my PhD candidacy exam back in November, 2018. So all I have left to graduate is to finish my research (which is nearly complete), write my thesis and defend.</p><p>On that note, I’m officially on the market for a real adult job. I’m looking for a research scientist position in any of the following areas: robots, human augmentation, neural interfaces, computational neuroscience, drug discovery, genetic editing, and synthetic biology.</p>
