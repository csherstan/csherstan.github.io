<p>This past summer I’ve had the incredible opportunity to do an internship with Cogitai (<a href="https://www.cogitai.com/">https://www.cogitai.com/</a>) - An AI startup started by some big names in the reinforcement learning community (Mark Ring, Satinder Singh, Peter Stone).</p><p>Cogitai is focused on continual learning (I wrote a class report on continual learning <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B38aGNAclj60dmFMT1MydzFJZVE">here</a>), which I believe is fairly unique in the AI community at this time. Continual learning is an approach to artificial general intelligence which assumes that you have an agent operating continually in the world, incrementally constructing knowledge and skill. </p><p>It was a great experience working with Cogitai, and I had the opportunity to work on a mix of research and product development.</p>
